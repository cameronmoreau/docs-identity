# Guide to using Pivotal Single Sign-On

This is a guide to the Pivotal Single Sign-On service, which enables Pivotal Cloud Foundry users to
authenticate with an external identity provider rather than having to create a new account or re-enter credentials. Single Sign-On grants users centralized access to applications in various spaces, as well as to Ops Manager, Apps Manager, and other Cloud Foundry components.

          When SSO v1.6 is ready to document, we can build a new 1.6 from the 1.5 branch
          and rename the original to keep as an archive.
