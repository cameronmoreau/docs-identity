# Single Sign-On (SSO) for PCF Docs

This repo contains the documentation for Single Sign-On for PCF, which enables Pivotal Cloud Foundry users to
authenticate with an external identity provider rather than having to create a new account or re-enter credentials. Single Sign-On grants users centralized access to applications in various spaces, as well as to Ops Manager, Apps Manager, and other Cloud Foundry components.
