Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is Microsoft's multi-tenant cloud based directory and identity management service. This documentation describes how to configure a single sign-on partnership between Azure AD as the Identity Provider (IdP) and the Single Sign-On Service (SSO) for Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; as the Service Provider (SP). 

SSO supports service provider-initiated authentication flow and single logout. It does not support identity provider-initiated authentication flow. All SSO communication takes place over SSL.
