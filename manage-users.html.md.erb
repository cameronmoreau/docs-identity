This topic describes how a Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Plan Administrator uses the Single Sign-On (SSO) service to manage user access to PCF apps, for users with accounts in the internal user store or with external identity providers.

## <a id="internal"></a> Manage Users in an Internal User Store

The SSO service has an **Internal Users** admin pane that lets you manage user accounts in PCF's internal user store: invite and delete users, request users to reset their passwords, and update user attributes and permissions.

To open the **Internal Users** pane:

1. Log in to the SSO dashboard at `https://p-identity.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN` using your User Account and Authentication (UAA) administrator credentials. Find these credentials in your Pivotal Elastic Runtime tile in Ops Manager under the **Credentials** tab.

1. Click the plan name and select **Manage Identity Providers** from the dropdown menu.

1. Click **Internal User Store** and select **Internal Users** from the dropdown menu. This brings you to the admin screen.

From the **Internal Users** pane, you can:

* **Invite users** by clicking **Invite User**, entering their email address, and clicking **Send Invite**.

* **Search existing users** by entering a value into the search bar and clicking **Search**. Entering a blank value will return all users in the service plan’s internal user store.

* Ask a verified user to **reset their password** by selecting the checkbox next to their username and clicking **Reset Password**.

* **Delete a user** by selecting the checkbox next to their username and clicking **Delete User**.

* **View information about a user** by clicking their username.

* **Update user permissions** by selecting the corresponding permissions and clicking **Save User**.

## <a id="external"></a> Manage Users from an External Identity Provider

For each external identity provider that the SSO service connects to, a users admin pane (example: **Okta SSO Users**) lets you browse, delete, and update PCF permissions for user accounts from external identity providers.

To open the external identity provider users admin pane:

1. Log into the SSO dashboard at `https://p-identity.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN` using your User Account and Authentication (UAA) administrator credentials. You can find these credentials in your Pivotal Elastic Runtime tile in Ops Manager under the **Credentials** tab.

1. Click the plan name and select **Manage Identity Providers** from the dropdown menu.

1. Click the external identity provider you wish to manage and select the **Users** choice for the provider from the dropdown menu. This brings you to the users admin pane.
