This topic describes how to evaluate the performance of the Single Sign-On (SSO) service for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

The SSO service relies on the performance of User Account and Authentication (UAA) component of Pivotal Application Service. 

See the following topics for information about how to monitor and interpret UAA performance:

* For information about UAA, see [Component: User Account and Authentication (UAA) Server](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/concepts/architecture/uaa.html).
* For information about UAA performance, see [UAA Performance](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/running/uaa-performance.html).
* For information about UAA metrics, see [UAA Metrics](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/kpi.html#uaa).
* For information about UAA scaling indicators, see [UAA VM CPU Utilization
