<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change: </strong>Before you upgrade the <strong>Pivotal Application Service</strong> tile to PCF v2.0, you must first upgrade the SSO tile to v1.5.3 and configure the AppsManager errand in OpsManager. To properly prepare for upgrading to PCF v2.0 with the SSO tile, see the <a href="https://discuss.pivotal.io/hc/en-us/articles/115015825568">SSO upgrade</a> knowledge base article.</p>

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: PAS does not support SHA1 to sign outbound SAML requests. If you use SHA1 with PCF v1.12, PAS automatically migrates your SAML signature algorithm to SHA256. If you are using SAML in PCF v1.12 through the SSO tile and your Identity Provider validates the signature of the SAML authentication request, see <a href="https://discuss.pivotal.io/hc/en-us/articles/115004791554">SHA Signature Support for SAML requests in PAS tile in PCF 2.0</a> in the Pivotal Knowledge Base.</p>
